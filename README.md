# linuxWorkEnv
Ansible playbooks to set up my minimal Linux Robot dev environment  
  
After initial install of the Linux machine, install ansible (e.g. for CentOS, Rocky etc `yum install -y ansible`), clone this repo and check each playbook for examples on how to invoke (they can be invoked in any order)
